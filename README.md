#### Some math drawings using Python

<hr>

# About  
Some math drawings done in Python, using mostly the OpenCV library.  
Inside each folder you'll find all the images I have produced, as well as the source code to generate them yourself.  
Have fun tweaking the constant values.

The _Trapped Knight_ is the oldest of these programs of mine, so it might show a less clean coding style than the new ones.

Only made for fun purposes.

## Dragon Curve  
Read about this fractal [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve) or watch [this Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCyC-K_PnRY). Evidently my favourite and my profile picture for several websites, including GitHub.

## Sierpinski Triangle constructed by chaos

Sierpinski Triangle constructed using [this](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-sierpinski-triangle-the-chaos-game.html) method. Emerges from chaos. It's very interesting.

## Fibonacci Spiral
The simplest of them all, a traditional Fibonacci Spiral.

## Mandelbrot Set
Learn (a very little bit) about this mind-baffling structure [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
