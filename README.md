### Some math drawings using Python

<hr>

# About  
Some math drawings done in Python, using mostly the OpenCV library.  
Inside each folder you'll find all the images I have produced, as well as the source code to generate them yourself.  
Have fun tweaking the constant values!

Only made for fun.  

<sub>The _Trapped Knight_ was coded by a less-smart version of myself, therefore the code is pretty bad. I may or may not re-do it.</sub>

## Dragon Curve  
Read about this fractal [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve) or watch [this Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCyC-K_PnRY).  
Evidently, my favourite self-similar fractal, which I use as my profile picture for several websites, including GitHub.

## Sierpinski Triangle constructed by chaos

Sierpinski Triangle constructed using something similar to [this](https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-sierpinski-triangle-the-chaos-game.html) method (changing the initial point from something within the triangle to just anywhere).  

Emerges from chaos. It's very interesting.

## Fibonacci Spiral
Maybe the simplest of them all, a traditional [Fibonacci Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral).

## Mandelbrot Set
Get a minuscule taste of what this mind-baffling structure is all about [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).  
I didn't do this program all by myself, but I don't remember where I got the code from.
